# Section 1
# ------------
# What is node.js
# ----------------
# Node.js is a javascript runtime that allows javascript code to run on the server. It leverages the chrome v8 engine for a executing and interpreting javascript code.


# Node.js role(in web development)
# ---------------------------------
# create server and listen to incoming requests
# handle requests, input validation and connect to database
# return responses(html, json, xml)


# core modules that ships with node.js
# ------------------------------------

# http--Launches a server and send requests
# https--launches a ssl server
# path
# fs
# os


# node.js program life cycle
# ---------------------------
# node app.js --> starts script --> parse code and register variables and functions --> event loop(Keeps on running as long as events are registered)



# node.js event driven architecture
# ----------------------------------

# event loop: event loop is at the core of node.js. It is a continously running process that checks the event queue for new events and execute associated callback functions.

# callbacks: callbacks are executed when the operation is complete.These are the associated functions which are executed after the operation is complete.

# Event queue: When an event occurs, the associated callback function is placed in the event queue. The event loop continuously checks the event queue for pending events and executes the corresponding callback functions in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner.


# How incoming requests are handled in node.js
# ---------------------------------------------

# incoming requests                     |---> Event loop(Handle event callbacks)
#        /|\                            | 
#  your code  single javascript thread---fs--Send to worker pool--> Different threads


# Event loop
# ----------
# As the event loop runs first of all it checks the timers i.e. setInterval or setTimeOut callbacks.
# Then it checks for pending callbacks (execute I/O related callbacks that were deferred)
# Then it enters the poll phase(retrieve new I/O events and execute their callbacks).It can jump to the first phase in case of setimeout and setInterval.
# After that it enters into check phase (execute setimmediate() callbacks)
# And the final phase is close callbacks(execute all close event callbacks)


# After res.end() we cannot send a response


# Section 2(Improved development and debugging)
# ----------
# npm stands for node package manager which is used to install packages.It is already installed with node.js.
# start is a special script which is a reserved keyword and should be named as start
# If you choose your specific name then you should have to start your script as npm run (script-name)

# There are two types of node packages which are stated as core packages and third party packages.These packages live in npm repository such as express.js, body-parser.

# for installing packages we can install them as production dependency or development dependency.
# for development dependency we can use for example npm install nodemon --save-dev and for production npm install nodemon --save

# package.json consists of project metadata like project name, description, project author etc while package-lock.json locks the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies.
